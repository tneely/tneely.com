  <h2>Hiring Mediocrity: How Epic Targets the Unambitious to Succeed</h2>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>Skilled labor becomes unskilled when there is a sufficient number of processes around it such that a layman, or group of laymen, may reproduce it.</p>
      <p>Epic is Flat. There are no levels or official titles for most of the company hierarchy. Since Epic targets new college graduates, everyone starts as a Software Developer and stays that way throughout their tenure. A product lead is a Software Developer. A team lead is a Software Developer. A senior developer is a Software Developer. A junior developer is a Software Developer.</p>

<!-- 

Main points:
- pay decent salary, but no stock or similar options
- flat raises (not % salary) keeps wages from balooning
- lowish (compared to big players) salary
- no path to promotion
- no incentive to seek greater responsibiliy
- rank to determine raises & bonuses, but that is hidden from employees
- wages raise tiers, etc. are hidden
- avoid competition by hiding comparisons (ranks)
